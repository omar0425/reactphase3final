# reactphase3final

I created this project for my phase 3 final at Flatiron School. I was inspired to make this project after watching Cobra Kai with my daughter. The characters used in this project are from the show. The names of the Dojo's are also from the show. This project meets all the requirements for the phase 3 final project. You can select a character to add to dojo, create your own dojo and create your own character.

## Documentation

You must have the backend running along with React to make this project work. In the ruby app run rake server. In the React app app, execute start. The app has 2 navigation buttons at the top one for characters and one for dojos. You can navigate between the list of provided and created characters and dojos. To begin add a character under the Add a character! heading by adding a character name and image url in the form fields. Press submit and your newest character should appear at the bottom. To create a dojo enter the name of the dojo you would like to create. Press submit and it appears in the dojo select menu on each character card. Select the dojo you would like each character to join. Press add to dojo and your character will be placed in the specified dojo. You can also delete a character by pressing the delete character button. This change cannot be undone unless the rake server database is reset. You can now press the dojo button at the top of the page and navigate the choose dojo dropdown to see your characters in the selected dojos.
